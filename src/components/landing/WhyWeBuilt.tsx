            We built Comovo because something was missing. Runners were searching for events and community. 
            Businesses were trying to reach people in meaningful ways. But there was no tool to bring them together.
          </p>
          
          <p>So we built the bridge â€” a platform where people and places meet through movement. Comovo is warming up in Madrid.</p>
